# Install and run Computer Vision containers

Containers enable you to run the Computer Vision APIs in your own environment. Containers are great for specific security and data governance requirements. In this article you'll learn how to download, install, and run a Computer Vision container.

There are two Docker containers available for Computer Vision: *Recognize Text* and *Read*. The *Recognize Text* container allows you to detect and extract *printed text* from images of various objects with different surfaces and backgrounds, such as receipts, posters, and business cards. The *Read* container, however; also detects *handwritten text* in images and provides PDF/TIFF/multi-page support. For more information, see the [Read API](concept-recognizing-text.md#read-api) documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Recognize Text container is being deprecated in favor of the Read container. The Read container is a superset of its predecessor the Recognize Text container, and consumers should migrate to using the Read container. Both containers work only with English.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites before using the containers:

|Required|Purpose|
|--|--|
|Docker Engine| You need the Docker Engine installed on a [host computer](#the-host-computer). Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms). For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/).<br><br> Docker must be configured to allow the containers to connect with and send billing data to Azure. <br><br> **On Windows**, Docker must also be configured to support Linux containers.<br><br>|
|Familiarity with Docker | You should have a basic understanding of Docker concepts, like registries, repositories, containers, and container images, as well as knowledge of basic `docker` commands.| 
|Computer Vision resource |In order to use the container, you must have:<br><br>An Azure **Computer Vision** resource and the associated API key the endpoint URI. Both values are available on the Overview and Keys pages for the resource and are required to start the container.<br><br>**{API_KEY}**: One of the two available resource keys on the **Keys** page<br><br>**{ENDPOINT_URI}**: The endpoint as provided on the **Overview** page|

## Get the container image with `docker pull`

# [Read](#tab/read)

Container images for Read are available.

| Container | Container Registry / Repository / Image Name |
|-----------|------------|
| Read | `containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-read:latest` |

# [Recognize Text](#tab/recognize-text)

Container images for Recognize Text are available.

| Container | Container Registry / Repository / Image Name |
|-----------|------------|
| Recognize Text | `containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-recognize-text:latest` |

***

Use the [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) command to download a container image.

# [Read](#tab/read)

### Docker pull for the Read container

```bash
docker pull containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-read:latest

## How to use the container

Once the container is on the [host computer](#the-host-computer), use the following process to work with the container.

1. [Run the container](#run-the-container-with-docker-run), with the required billing settings. More [examples](computer-vision-resource-container-config.md) of the `docker run` command are available. 
1. [Query the container's prediction endpoint](#query-the-containers-prediction-endpoint). 

## Run the container with `docker run`

Use the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command to run the container. Refer to [gathering required parameters](#gathering-required-parameters) for details on how to get the `{ENDPOINT_URI}` and `{API_KEY}` values.

[Examples](computer-vision-resource-container-config.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available.

# [Read](#tab/read)

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 16g --cpus 8 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-read \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

This command:

* Runs the Read container from the container image.
* Allocates 8 CPU core and 16 gigabytes (GB) of memory.
* Exposes TCP port 5000 and allocates a pseudo-TTY for the container.
* Automatically removes the container after it exits. The container image is still available on the host computer.

# [Recognize Text](#tab/recognize-text)

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 16g --cpus 8 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-recognize-text \
Eula=accept \
Billing={ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={API_KEY}
```

This command:

* Runs the Recognize Text container from the container image.
* Allocates 8 CPU core and 16 gigabytes (GB) of memory.
* Exposes TCP port 5000 and allocates a pseudo-TTY for the container.
* Automatically removes the container after it exits. The container image is still available on the host computer.

***

More [examples](./computer-vision-resource-container-config.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start.  For more information, see [Billing](#billing).

[!INCLUDE [Running multiple containers on the same host](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-run-multiple-same-host.md)]

<!--  ## Validate container is running -->

[!INCLUDE [Container's API documentation](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-api-documentation.md)]

## Query the container's prediction endpoint

The container provides REST-based query prediction endpoint APIs. 

Use the host, `http://localhost:5000`, for container APIs.

# [Read](#tab/read)

### Asynchronous read

You can use the `POST /vision/v2.0/read/core/asyncBatchAnalyze` and `GET /vision/v2.0/read/operations/{operationId}` operations in concert to asynchronously read an image, similar to how the Computer Vision service uses those corresponding REST operations. The asynchronous POST method will return an `operationId` that is used as the identifer to the HTTP GET request.

From the swagger UI, select the `asyncBatchAnalyze` to expand it in the browser. Then select **Try it out** > **Choose file**. In this example, we'll use the following image:

![tabs vs spaces](media/tabs-vs-spaces.png)

When the asynchronous POST has run successfully, it returns an **HTTP 202** status code. As part of the response, there is an `operation-location` header that holds the result endpoint for the request.

```http
 content-length: 0
 date: Fri, 13 Sep 2019 16:23:01 GMT
 operation-location: http://localhost:5000/vision/v2.0/read/operations/a527d445-8a74-4482-8cb3-c98a65ec7ef9
 server: Kestrel
```

The `operation-location` is the fully qualified URL and is accessed via an HTTP GET. Here is the JSON response from executing the `operation-location` URL from the preceding image:

```json

  "status": "Succeeded",
  "recognitionResults": [

            }
          ]

          ],
          "text": "Spaces",
          "words": [
            {
              "boundingBox": [
                230,
                148,
                416,
                141,
                419,
                211,
                232,
                218
              ],
              "text": "Spaces"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Synchronous read

You can use the `POST /vision/v2.0/read/core/Analyze` operation to synchronously read an image. When the image is read in its entirety, then and only then does the API return a JSON response. The only exception to this is if an error occurs. When an error occurs the following JSON is returned:

```json
{
    status: "Failed"
}
```

The JSON response object has the same object graph as the asynchronous version. If you're a JavaScript user and want type safety, the following types could be used to cast the JSON response as an `AnalyzeResult` object.

```typescript
export interface AnalyzeResult {
    status: Status;
    recognitionResults?: RecognitionResult[] | null;
}

export enum Status {
    NotStarted = 0,
    Running = 1,
    Failed = 2,
    Succeeded = 3
}

export enum Unit {
    Pixel = 0,
    Inch = 1
}

export interface RecognitionResult {
    page?: number | null;
    clockwiseOrientation?: number | null;
    width?: number | null;
    height?: number | null;
    unit?: Unit | null;
    lines?: Line[] | null;
}

export interface Line {
    boundingBox?: number[] | null;
    text: string;
    words?: Word[] | null;
}

export interface Word {
  boundingBox?: number[] | null;
  text: string;
  confidence?: string | null;
}
```

For an example use-case, see the [TypeScript sandbox here](https://aka.ms/ts-read-api-types) and select "Run" to visualize its ease-of-use.

# [Recognize Text](#tab/recognize-text)

### Asynchronous text recognition

You can use the `POST /vision/v2.0/recognizeText` and `GET /vision/v2.0/textOperations/*{id}*` operations in concert to asynchronously recognize printed text in an image, similar to how the Computer Vision service uses those corresponding REST operations. The Recognize Text container only recognizes printed text, not handwritten text, at this time, so the `mode` parameter normally specified for the Computer Vision service operation is ignored by the Recognize Text container.

### Synchronous text recognition

You can use the `POST /vision/v2.0/recognizeTextDirect` operation to synchronously recognize printed text in an image. Because this operation is synchronous, the request body for this operation is the same as the `POST /vision/v2.0/recognizeText` operation, but the response body for this operation is the same as that returned by the `GET /vision/v2.0/textOperations/*{id}*` operation.

## Stop the container

[!INCLUDE [How to stop the container](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-stop.md)]

## Troubleshooting

If you run the container with an output [mount](./computer-vision-resource-container-config.md#mount-settings) and logging enabled, the container generates log files that are helpful to troubleshoot issues that happen while starting or running the container. 

## Billing

The Cognitive Services containers send billing information to Azure, using the corresponding resource on your Azure account.

[!INCLUDE [Container's Billing Settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-how-to-billing-info.md)]

For more information about these options, see [Configure containers](./computer-vision-resource-container-config.md).

## Summary

In this article, you learned concepts and workflow for downloading, installing, and running Computer Vision containers. In summary:

* Computer Vision provides a Linux container for Docker, encapsulating both Recognize Text and Read.
* Container images are downloaded from the "Container Preview" container registry in Azure.
* Container images run in Docker.
* You can use either the REST API or SDK to call operations in Recognize Text or Read containers by specifying the host URI of the container.
* You must specify billing information when instantiating a container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cognitive Services containers are not licensed to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate billing information with the metering service at all times. Cognitive Services containers do not send customer data (for example, the image or text that is being analyzed) to Microsoft.

## Next steps
